#Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

#I love you
#a little
#a lot
#passionately
#madly
#not at all
#When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

#Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say for a flower of a given number of petals, where nb_petals > 0.

#My Solution
def how_much_i_love_you(nb_petals)
    # code here
     case nb_petals % 6
       when 1 ; "I love you"
       when 2 ; "a little"
       when 3 ; "a lot"
       when 4 ; "passionately"
       when 5 ; "madly"
       when 0 ; "not at all"
     end
end
