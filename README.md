# Codewars
These are my solutions to codewars code katas. My profile in codewars can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/HOOLAHAN). 

Languages used here are (at the moment):

**Ruby** (mainly)

**JavaScript** (gradually)

_IMPORTANT NOTE:_

This repo includes my own solutions and just posting them helps me keep the pace, code on a daily basis, and improve as a developer. Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my solutions to Kata until they have completed it themselves or at least taken the time to think about their own approaches.

This is my Codewarrior Profile Badge, current status:
